# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Duong

I graduated from University of Economics HCMC and started first job as a Marketing Executive for Mercedes-Benz Vietnam. Over five years working in the field I made a big decision to change career paths and become a software engineer. Now I enjoys every working day with front-end tasks and challenges myself to become a principal engineer in the future.

# I use:

- Macbook M1 Pro 14" + Magic Keyboard + Logitech MX Mouse
- VSCode Editor + Postico + SmartGit
- Obsidian: CMS with markdown files and personal notes
- Remnote: to remember things
- Notion: to save [links from the Internet](/links)

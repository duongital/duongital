Hello! I'm Duong. I graduated from University of Economics HCMC and started first job as a Marketing Executive for Mercedes-Benz Vietnam. Over five years working in the field I made a big decision to change career paths and become a software engineer. Now I enjoys every working day with front-end tasks and challenges myself to become a principal engineer in the future.

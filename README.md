Hello! I'm Duong. I graduated from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City and began my career as a Marketing Executive at Mercedes-Benz Vietnam. After five years in marketing, I made a significant career change to become a software engineer. Now, I enjoy every workday tackling front-end tasks, and I'm challenging myself to become a principal engineer in the future.

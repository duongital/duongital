> If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, youâ€™ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.

- 1st gen: machine code
- 2nd gen: Assembly (machine dependent)
- 3rd gen: FORTRAN, Cobol (machine independent)
- 4th gen: C, Lisp, ML

language paradigms:

- imperative or procedural << tell the approach the program process by finding an algorithm, step by step on how to calculate.
- declarative << describe the problem to be solved rather than an algorithm to be followed (using libraries and interfaces).
- functional << programming process under the functional paradigm is that of building functions as nested complexes of simple functions.
- oop << all things are objects, in an object can contain a method that present an small imperative paradigm. 

Constant should be used over literal value, it's easier to understand.

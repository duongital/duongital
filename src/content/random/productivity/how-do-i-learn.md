# General steps

## Step 1:  planning 

1. what to learn (computer science, database, math, tennis, yoga...)
2. how much time we want to spend for: 1 month or 6 months...
3. ask AI for the detailed plans for a specific amount of time.

## Step 2:  finding the materials

1. reading books
2. watch tutorial videos
3. read blogs or articles from the Internet

Don't need to follow all or a specific plan, just find ones that we feel comfortable with. Each document just suits best for a target level.

## Step 3: write documents

All documents don't suit us, we need to take notes to save knowledge by our own way, this help to summarize topics or look up after months.

1. take notes by a favorite editor: using notebook or apps like Notion, Obsidian...
2. remind knowledge using spaced repetition technique: Remnote, physical boxes...
3. (optional) practice over and over again by special skill like: solving a DSA problem, building a chat app, finding a system design topic...

Differentiate between remember and practice. We remember patterns but practice a DSA problem. Can't remember all the way to solve a problem.

# Important

During learning something, at a time we feel that the knowledge can be understandable but later we can forget that one. So that the step 3-2 is really important, take your time to remember and read again and again.

But this might not true for type of skill like solving a DSA problem, we need to practice over time to keep the momentum. It depends on how long we need to keep it. Same as for running or swimming, the less we practice, the weaker we do after months.

I do a lot of stuff during daily basis, I am sure that all articles in my blog I don't remember all detailed steps that I discover. So that writing a blog or a presentation on Youtube also a good way to save your memories.

DFS over BFS. Remember one topic have so many levels, for example: computer science (OS, networking, database...), we don't need to deep dive in one topic for a long time. What we need to do is traversing from topics to topics that in basic. Later on, we can see an overview of the picture and target to an advanced topic would be more approachable.

# Example

Topic: database

Step 1:

I have one month and ask ChatGPT to generate a detailed plan for me to learn. It is divided into 4 weeks and quite useful

Step 2:

Based on each topic of a week, I try to search on the internet: videos, articles and buy a cookbook on the topic.

Step 3:

I created a new file `7-database.md` to Obsidian and start writing notes there. But later I feel like Remnote can handle notes and spaced repetition so that I cover all there (write note and remind knowledge).

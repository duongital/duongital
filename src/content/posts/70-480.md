Is Pearson VUE (PV) a testing center? Some large organizations like Microsoft, Ruby, Python, and Oracle do not want to organize exams in every country, so PV is an agency that helps with that.

Since it depends on the local agency, we should list famous places in your province. During this time, we will do our best until two weeks before the actual exam, and then register for it.

A small tip is to subscribe to the places where you intend to register, as they may offer discounts while you are following them. When I took the exam, I received a 50% discount if I failed and took it again.

Finally, I chose Robusta Technology Center located in Nguyen Cong Tru, District 1. The quality is okay, but if I had a second chance, I would choose FTMS Nguyen Thi Minh Khai, as I heard some good reviews from the community.

Some notes after taking the exam:

- Only the content from the original book is acceptable. It seems that all the questions come from it.
- If you want to achieve the maximum score, you should learn from outside sources.
- There are still some rare questions about `closure`, `call`, `bind`, `apply`, etc., so we should learn all of them.

# notes

my notes on learning code, they are sorted and named not in any order, I just give it a general name to search when need to find related query in a specific topic.

- learn algorithm and data structure: `c++`
- learn `rust` to do practical projects: cli, terminal, GUI with Ice, Game with Bevy, small libraries...
- learn frontend `javascript` and its type safety with `typescript`

## important notes:

- learn a basic language `c-cplusplus`
- then practice with `data-structure` and `algorithm`
- understand about `ubuntu`, a popular linux implementation

## frontend:

- basic with `html` `css` and `javascript`
- type checking with `typescript`
- iOS or android with `react native`
- cross platform apps with web stack, thanks to `tauri` rust package

## backend:

- known languages on top of JS: `nodejs` `deno` or `bun`
- some modern languages: `rust`, `go`
- query database with `sql`

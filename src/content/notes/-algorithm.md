# search

linear search and binary search

## linear search

loop through all elements and find the value


## binary search

this is sorted array and then use binary search method

# sort

## bubble sort

use two loops to sort


# graph algorithm


# pattern searching


# geometric algorithm


# math


# random


# greedy

examples: Dijkstra, Prim

`greedy algorithm` is used for choosing current selection and then choose another best solution afterwards. They all depend on each other.


# dynamic programing

examples: 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Incresing Subsequence

`dynamic programing`: almost all problems can be solved by recursive back tracking approach, but this method is slow and multiple calculations repeat all the time. In order to tackle this, we use `dynamic programming` to solve the problem.



# divide and conquer


# backtracking

examples: sudoku solution


# branch and bound

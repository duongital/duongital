description: 'Serveral languages using functional paradigm'
---

below are list of some functional programming languages:

# ocaml

first we need to install ocaml package mananger `brew install opam`
then install what we like in ocaml ecosystem `opam install dune ocaml`...
initialize a project with `dune init project hello_world`
build a project with `dune build` and then run it with `dune exec ./bin/main.exe`

- ocaml still support OOP, maybe learning Elixir at first is a better glance of pure functional programming language

# haskell

- only support functional, good start to understand concepts

# erlang & elixir

- running BEAM (Erlang virtual machine)

# scala

- also support OOP
- running on JVM (Java virtual machine)

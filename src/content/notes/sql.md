## What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's how we talk to databases — like asking a big library to find or organize books for you.

## What is a database?

A database is like a smart, organized digital notebook where you keep stuff: names, numbers, notes, anything!

## What is a table?

A table is like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Each row is one item (like a person), and each column is a detail (like their name or age).

## Basic SQL commands:

- **SELECT** – Ask the database to show something
- **INSERT** – Add something new
- **UPDATE** – Change something
- **DELETE** – Remove something

## What is a primary key?

A special column that helps tell rows apart — like a student ID. Every row must have a different one.

## What is a foreign key?

A column that connects one table to another — like saying "this book belongs to that student."

## What is JOIN?

JOIN is like building a bigger table by combining info from two smaller tables. You can:

- **INNER JOIN**: only matching rows
- **LEFT JOIN**: all from the left, plus matching from right
- **RIGHT JOIN**: all from the right, plus matching from left
- **FULL JOIN**: all rows from both

## What is WHERE?

It’s like adding a filter. “Show me only students older than 10.”

## What is ORDER BY?

It sorts your answers — like sorting names alphabetically or scores from highest to lowest.

## What is GROUP BY?

Group things together and get totals, averages, etc. “Group by class and count how many students.”

## What is NULL?

NULL means "nothing here." It's like an empty box. Not 0, not blank — just not known.

## What is INDEX?

An index is like a shortcut to find data faster — like a book’s index page.

## What is a transaction?

A set of steps that must all work or none do. Like building LEGO: if one brick falls, you take it all apart and start over.

## What is normalization?

A way to organize data to avoid repeats. Instead of writing a teacher’s name in every student row, you put teachers in a separate table and link it.

## What is SQL injection?

A trick bad people use to sneak fake commands into your database. That’s why we never trust user input!

## What is a view?

A saved SQL query that acts like a pretend table. You can use it like a shortcut to get common results.

## What is a stored procedure?

A saved set of SQL steps you can run again and again — like a recipe.

## What is ACID in databases?

- **A**: Atomic – all or nothing
- **C**: Consistent – always follows rules
- **I**: Isolated – no mix-ups with other actions
- **D**: Durable – even if power goes out, the result stays

## What is a schema?

A plan that says what tables are in your database and what’s in each table.

## Final tip:

SQL is like talking to a robot librarian — be clear, specific, and careful with your words!

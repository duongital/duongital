## What is the Web?

The Web is like a giant library where each book is a website, and you can read them using your browser.

## What is a Browser?

A browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is a special app that lets you visit websites, watch videos, read news, and more.

## What happens when you type a website?

1. You type something like `google.com`
2. Your computer asks DNS: “Where is google.com?”
3. It finds the address (IP address)
4. The browser connects to that address
5. It asks the website for the page
6. The website sends it
7. Your browser shows it on your screen

## What is HTTP and HTTPS?

HTTP is the way browsers talk to websites. HTTPS is the safe version that locks the messages with encryption.

## What is DNS?

DNS is like the Web’s phone book. It helps your computer find the exact address of a website.

## What is an IP address?

It’s like a house number on the internet — every website has one.

## What is HTML, CSS, JavaScript?

- **HTML**: The structure of a webpage (like the walls)
- **CSS**: The style (colors, fonts, layout)
- **JavaScript**: Makes things move or react (like buttons that work)

## What is a cookie?

A cookie is a tiny note your browser keeps so websites remember you — like your login or preferences.

## What is localStorage?

It’s a place where websites can save stuff inside your browser — like remembering dark mode.

## What is cache?

Cache stores parts of websites on your computer so they load faster next time.

## What is a tab?

Each tab is like a separate room in your browser where a different website lives.

## Can websites talk to each other?

Not directly. That’s a rule to keep your information safe — called the same-origin policy.

## What is DevTools?

It’s a tool built into your browser that lets you peek at how websites work. Kind of like “View Source,” but fancier.

## What is rendering?

Rendering is when your browser turns the website code into something you can see and use.

## What is a search engine?

A search engine (like Google or Bing) helps you find websites by keywords.

## What are browser extensions?

Mini apps that add features to your browser — like blocking ads or changing colors.

## What is responsive design?

It means a website looks good on any screen — big like a computer or small like a phone.

## What is a hyperlink?

A hyperlink is a clickable word or image that takes you to another page — like magic doors!

## What is a web server?

It’s the computer that sends you the website when you ask for it.

We can easily find the answer from Google. Likewise, I do it for many times and find that searched results usually not satisfied from my point of view, especially the first 10 results, and we don't have motivation on second page.

I often follow new feeds of favorite pages and gather them in a place called Feedly. Every morning or having free time, Feedly will update news from the sources, this is single source of information and I don't take time to open new tabs with different pages. Then we can categorize specific subjects as: digital marketing, graphics design, code developers, personal development... so that when I have interests on most one and read it.

Most of foreign pages they have an RSS section, we can copy this link and paste to Feedly and create a source. Or sometimes we just search a publisher name and get a wanted result. Vietnamese sources are quite difficult, for example I often read news from Techtalk and Brandsvietnam, and they don't have a section to add RSS. So that I end up with following their Facebook pages and getting news from my personal social account, hm... sometimes getting news from friends and publishers is interesting.

A small tip is that these pages must be a blog or long articles with frequently once per week. For those have so many feeds a day we should visit them directly from browser, if not we have a notification hell with Feedly and very annoyed.

One special thing I would like to mention is that my suggestion has effect as long as we have a habit to open Feedly every single day. For example, we have a habit to open Tiktok every day, obviously this is naturally reminding ourselves on next day that we have a thing to open. Having a new habit is hard, we must practice and have a commitment for a long time. Thanks for reading util this word, I hope that you have an insight while getting through this small talks.

P/S: I follow fintech startup from: Crunchbase and index.co ;)

First is Pearson VUE (PV) center? Some big organizations as Microsoft, Ruby, Python, Orcacle... they don't want to organize examinations in each country around the world and PV is an agency helps to handle that.

Because it depends on local agency so that we should list out famous places in your province.

During the time, we just try our best until two weeks before real examination and then register to do that.

Small tip is to subribe for places that you intend to register, maybe they will have discount during the time you are following. At the time I take the exam, I get an 50% discount if failed and taking the second one :D

At last, I choose Robusta Technoly Center located on Nguyen Cong Tru District 1. The quanlity is ok but if having second time, I would like to choose FTMS Nguyen Thi Minh Khai, I heard some good reviews from community.

Some notes after taking the exam:

- Just only content coming from original book is fined. Seems all questions getting from it.
- If you want to get maximum score, we should learn from outside sources.
- Rare questions as `closure`, `call`, `bind`, `apply`... still asked so we should learn all of them.
- `w3schools` still my best learning resource from beginning.
